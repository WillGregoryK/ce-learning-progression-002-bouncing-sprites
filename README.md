## Step 1

### 1.3.1

**Question 1.1.1:**

   *Enumerate the values of the loop variable i takes as the while loop is executed.*
   
   The values of the loop variable are origonaly set to 0, because of the second to last line i=i+1 is used to count up from 1, 2, 3 ect
    
**Question 1.1.2:**    
  
  *What is the value of the loop variable after the termination of the loop? Hint: Skim the reference section on block-scoping of variables.*
  
  The final loop of the funtion for "i" is 10.
  
**Question 1.1.3:**

  *Enumerate the different unsigned binary integers you can represent with 4 bits?*
  
  The unsigned binary integers can be written as numb

## Step 1

### 1.3.1
  Question 1.1.1: Enumerate the values of the loop variable i takes as the while loop is executed.
  
  MAX_ITER=10 is the number counter, or the number of iterations. i repersents the constant in the while loop
  
  Question 1.1.2: What is the value of the loop variable after the termination of the loop? Hint: Skim the reference section on block-scoping of variables.
  
  The value should be 10 because i=i+1 repeats until it reaches the number of interations
  
  Question 1.1.3: Enumerate the different unsigned binary integers you can represent with 4 bits?
